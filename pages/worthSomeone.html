        <h3>Worth someone</h3> <br>

        <p>
            My heart breaks, <br>
            When I lay in bed at nights <br>
            and wonders why I am not enough <br>
            or not worthy for that only one <br>
            person whom I give my whole <br>
            world to. <br>
            That ruins me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you how much pain <br>
            it takes to hold that 'I Love You' <br>
            on my tongue each and every time <br>
            when we talk just cause <br>
            I know that you are not going <br>
            to reply me back. <br>
            Even if I beg you for the mercy <br>
            or even if I'll be on my <br>
            death bed.
        </p>

        <p>
            I burn my eyes on the screens <br>
            so that I can become something <br>
            which can make you think that <br>
            I am also worth someone to <br>
            love too. <br>
            Every moment I try to <br>
            become a better person <br>
            for you and for the coming <br>
            future.
        </p>

        <p>
            It makes me cry during <br>
            sleepless nights where <br>
            I only think that what is <br>
            still missing to show my <br>
            inner feelings. <br>
            I feel the urges to hold your <br>
            hands and to hold you <br>
            closer to me so that <br>
            no one can ever rob you this <br>
            time from me.
        </p>

        <p>
            People say that it's the <br>
            waiting time which tells you <br>
            about the amount of love <br>
            I have for you, guess what! <br>
            I've waited and I am still waiting <br>
            till this very next moment. <br>
            5 years, 1 month, 10 days, <br>
            19 hours, 20 minutes and <br>
            the remaining seconds. <br>
            Till you'll read this many more <br>
            moments would have <br>
            been passed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every single time my screen <br>
            brightens up with some notification <br>
            I tend to hope that it's your message <br>
            saying that I am the one who <br>
            finally deserves your love, or <br>
            even just a message sharing <br>
            about your day. <br>
            I might be the fastest person <br>
            to reply back to your messages <br>
            But darling it's just the love <br>
            towards you which makes <br>
            me to.
        </p>

        <p>
            You might be thinking <br>
            that I may be bluffing <br>
            or lying to the top most <br>
            level but you know that <br>
            I am not, when you were <br>
            not there then I literally went <br>
            on the worst track. <br>
            The level of love you can <br>
            think about that you are <br>
            the only girl my mother is <br>
            aware of.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am not a person who'll <br>
            try to prove his love to you <br>
            and I am definitely not a <br>
            person who like extra <br>
            materialism. <br>
            I just want to be loved <br>
            by you, just want to feel <br>
            special that there is you <br>
            who loves me the way <br>
            I Love You.
        </p>

        <br><br><br>
