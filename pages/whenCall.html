        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be calm, but I might be struggling to hide that over-excitement after hearing your voice after so long.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Speak as much as you can, and let me cry over it silently cause this was the thing which I've been craving for.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Ask me about how I've been these days, and ask me that how I was holding myself.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell me that you are proud of me, and how you've always been there just beside me.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me tell you about all those dreams in which I saw you, and you tell me about yours.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell me how you imagined me by your side during the night, and slept.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Just tell me that you can't play this game of 'hiding the emotions' anymore.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            When you'll call me,
        </p>
        <p>
            Just tell me that you also missed me.
