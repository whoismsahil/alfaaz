        <h3>My kind of love</h3> <br>

        <p>
            Feeling that tightness of the hugs, <br>
            And the warmth of the kisses, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winking at each other while in a group of people, <br>
            Holding our laughs so that no one can spot, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trying to hold the hands tightly, <br>
            Like we are never gonna meet again, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hitting your knees with my knees when we sit together, <br>
            And you reminding me that I can't leave this habit of mine, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sipping the last tea from my cup, <br>
            Still after falling in love with coffee, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Spending the night by sitting on the beach, <br>
            Your head on my shoulder and stargazing is what we need, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Doing mimicry of each otherâ€™s action, <br>
            And realizing that we know each other from a millennium, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fighting over like some cat & mouse, <br>
            But in the end your head on my chest, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Closing the lights and pulling the bed sheet, <br>
            Watching some horror movies, probably that's our Netflix and chill, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making my favorite foods, <br>
            And waiting for the reactions after I consume, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making you win all the arguments we do, <br>
            Just for those sparkling smile of yours, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hands on your waist and yours over my neck, <br>
            Dancing all night over the song which we like, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sitting in the balcony when the drizzle falls, <br>
            Water on our feets and singing all the love songs, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Supporting each other in anything we do, <br>
            Just with the one line message which pump me through, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hardship is nothing but a phase of darkness, <br>
            We'll fight together till the end of our life, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Who asks for the bodies, duh! <br>
            I only crave for the feelings inside you, <br>
            Isn't this really something like my kind of love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Isn't this really something like <b>OUR</b> kind of love.
        </p>
