        <h3>Walking down the streets</h3> <br>

        <p>
            I'm waiting for that day <br>
            When we'll be standing, <br>
            On the pathway <br>
            Near the Eiffel Tower, <br>
            Flaunting the beauty <br>
            Of this mesmerizing iron structure, <br>
            Under the serene moonlight.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll be wearing <br>
            That black dress of yours, <br>
            Which you saved <br>
            For this very moment, <br>
            With a touch of <br>
            Our Indian Culture, <br>
            Forcing me to compare <br>
            Between you and <br>
            That metal with lights, <br>
            I'll be wearing <br>
            My black tuxedo, <br>
            Which you gave it to me <br>
            On my last birthday.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll be thanking each other, <br>
            That no matter what <br>
            We've always been together, <br>
            Time will be running out <br>
            And it's already past 2 AM, <br>
            We'll decide to walk back <br>
            To our hotel, <br>
            On this never ending <br>
            Streets of Paris.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other <br>
            Side of the road, <br>
            There's a violinist, <br>
            Playback some jazzy <br>
            Funky song, <br>
            We'll be more than ready <br>
            To dance together, <br>
            Under that shiny <br>
            Bright street light, <br>
            Tables have turned now <br>
            With slow soothing sounds, <br>
            My hands on your waist <br>
            And yours over my shoulder.
        </p>

        <p>
            The temperature might be dropping <br>
            Cause it's a country with cold nights, <br>
            I'll wrap you up with my jacket <br>
            Holding hands, and your <br>
            Never ending talks, <br>
            Your feets will be sore <br>
            Because of those <br>
            High heels you wore, <br>
            I'll be down on my knees, <br>
            Helping you to remove <br>
            Those weird things <br>
            From your feets, <br>
            You'll be bare feet now <br>
            And your heels in my hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll hold the walk, <br>
            And suddenly I'll pull <br>
            You into my arms, <br>
            My eyes can <br>
            End up being teary, <br>
            But that'll definitely not <br>
            Gonna ruin this moment, <br>
            We'll find a seat <br>
            Right next to few trees, <br>
            Stargazing and doing <br>
            Arguments over our <br>
            Favorite Indian sweets.
        </p>

        <p>
            Forgetting the world <br>
            And forgetting the life, <br>
            Living the moment, <br>
            Cause who knows that <br>
            We'll even see tomorrow alive, <br>
            Your head on my shoulder <br>
            And my head over your head, <br>
            The feeling is beyond <br>
            To be expressed, <br>
            Hours passed <br>
            Still we are not over each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Birds have started to chirp, <br>
            It's the dusk which we  <br>
            Were waiting for, <br>
            Now it's definitely time, <br>
            To move our feets <br>
            Towards our hotel street, <br>
            The whole night <br>
            We didn't sleep, <br>
            Still our faces are brighter <br>
            Than those Bentley's <br>
            Of the rich kids. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The night passed by, <br>
            And it's crazy how <br>
            We finally get to <br>
            Live our dream, <br>
            We were happy <br>
            That finally our <br>
            World get collided, <br>
            I became yours <br>
            And you finally <br>
            Became mine.
        </p>
